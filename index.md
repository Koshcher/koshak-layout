## Why balance?

Below are the average percentages for each hand. QWERTY has about a 4% lean towards the left while Colemak leans to
the right by about 5%, and Dvorak, 7%. **Koshak balances the
load between the left and right hands near 50% (leans to
the right by only 1.5%).**

## Why speed?
Speed is about typing efficiency. You can see it in comparison with other layouts.
