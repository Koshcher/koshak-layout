## About
I’ve tried many different ways to help make it better. One way to do this is to switch to a different keyboard layout other than [QWERTY](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY). QWERTY was supposedly designed for typewriters to solve a very specific problem–to keep the types from jamming against each other. The most frequently used keys were placed apart from each other to prevent them from jamming. This results in a non-ergonomic layout. However, there are alternatives.
